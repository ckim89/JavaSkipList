JavaSkipList
============

Skip List data structure created with java. 
This skip list was created as to test benchmarks between
java and C. 

I was able to run few tests, and It seems that Java is running 
the implementation faster than C is. The algorithm used is pretty
much the same for both implementations, but I cannot reason why C
would be slower than Java. 

As of now, the driver runs the skip list so that the Get operation
is running twice as often as the insert or delete functions.
